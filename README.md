# How will your contribution be used?

It is a custom for programmers to link back to the Github repository where their open source software is located. We as programmers love Github so we often spread the Github love as much as possible via various merchandise.

Your art will be used as images in links that redirect to Github.com or as stickers.

# Examples of what can be done!
